## Brand Color Palette

### Primary Colors
The core palette is stark and authoritative:
- **Black**: `#111111` - Primary text, backgrounds, authoritative presence
- **White**: `#FFFFFF` - Contrast, clean backgrounds, logo on dark

### Usage Guidelines
- **High-contrast scheme** creates clean, authoritative appearance
- Black often used as background or primary text color
- White provides maximum contrast (white text/logo on black background, or vice versa)
- **Monochromatic palette** reinforces consistent, professional appearance
- **No off-brand colors** - logo rendered in solid black or white only
- Supplementary grays chosen to complement black/white scheme while maintaining readability

### Accent Colors (Minimal Use)
- **Muted supplementary hues** used sparingly if at all
- Emphasis on neutrality allows campaign-specific graphics or client branding to stand out
- Any additional colors must maintain the understated, professional backdrop
